# Polygon-Image-Recreation
A java program used to recreate a target image using primitive polygons.
This project was made over the summer of 2022 to practice Java development.

1. Import any image as a PNG into the input folder (smaller images work better, with 600x800 being a good size).
2. Name the image "target.png".
3. Run the program, with an expected runtime of around 5-8 hours.
4. The renders will output in the animation_output folder, with a set of numbered frames as well as a main.png image which contains the most recent render.
5. Terminate the program at any time once the correct level of detail is achieved.
6. The animation frames can be stitched together using third party software like Blender.
